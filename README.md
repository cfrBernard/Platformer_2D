# 2D Platformer Game Project

## Background

This project is an ongoing 2D game development adventure, created using Unity. The goal is to build a platformer inspired by classics in the genre while adding unique gameplay mechanics and elements of introspective narrative.

The project is currently in the prototyping phase, with a strong focus on smooth character movement and exploring advanced gameplay mechanics.

## Project Ambition

This game aims to combine intuitive and engaging gameplay with an emotionally rich experience. It draws inspiration from *Metroidvania* games and classic platformers, while aiming to explore a deeper narrative. The goal is to offer the player an introspective journey filled with challenges and discoveries.

## Current Focus

At this stage, the focus is on developing the core gameplay mechanics, with particular attention to:

- Camera System
- Character movement
- Establishing a solid foundation for future gameplay features

The aim is to create a robust foundation that can later be enriched with new mechanics, characters, and varied environments.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity**: Game engine for development
- **C#**: Primary programming language
- **Pixel Art**: Art style for characters and environments

## What's Coming

Once the prototyping phase and gameplay stabilization are complete, the focus will shift to:
- Level design
- Music and sound effects integration
- UI and player feedback improvements
- A playable demo version
